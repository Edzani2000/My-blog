 <div class="col">Education technology (EdTech) is transforming the way people learn, breaking barriers to access and creating opportunities for students of all backgrounds. Online learning platforms like Khan Academy, Coursera, and Duolingo are providing affordable and often free educational resources to millions worldwide. These platforms offer flexibility, allowing learners to study at their own pace and from virtually anywhere. By leveraging tools such as interactive videos, gamified learning, and AI-driven personalization, EdTech solutions cater to diverse learning styles, making education more engaging and effective. This accessibility is particularly impactful in underserved regions, where traditional educational infrastructure may be limited.</p>
 <blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Beyond accessibility, EdTech is equipping individuals with the skills needed for the modern workforce. Platforms focused on coding, digital marketing, and data analytics are closing the skills gap by offering specialized training tailored to industry demands. Schools and universities are also integrating technology into classrooms, blending traditional teaching methods with digital tools to enhance learning experiences. Moreover, EdTech startups are empowering educators with analytics to track student progress and identify areas for improvement. This democratization of education is not only reshaping how knowledge is delivered but also ensuring that the tools for success are within reach of anyone with an internet connection.</p>
